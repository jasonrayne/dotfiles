# dotfiles

My personal system configurations managed with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io). Primarily tested on CachyOS and Ubuntu 24.04, both using NVIDIA.

Currently focuses on the bare neccesseties like tmux, neovim, etc. More dots and docs coming as I continue to organize and stabilize. Until then, use at your own risk.
